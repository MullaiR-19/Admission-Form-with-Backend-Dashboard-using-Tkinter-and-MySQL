##Tkinter-Based Admission Form with Back-End Dashboard

This is an admission form application built using the Tkinter GUI toolkit in Python. The application allows students to fill out an admission form and submit it to the school for consideration. 

The front-end of the application is built using Tkinter and provides a user-friendly interface for students to input their personal details such as name, date of birth, contact information, and academic background.

The back-end of the application is built also using Tkinter and provides a dashboard for school administrators to view the submitted admission forms.

The application stores the submitted admission forms in a SQLite database. The database schema is designed to efficiently store and retrieve the student data. 

This application is useful for schools and universities that want to streamline their admission process. It demonstrates how to build a basic desktop application with Tkinter and can be used as a starting point for developing more complex admission form applications.
